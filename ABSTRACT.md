# Abstract

## Auto Intel: An End-to-End Automotive Data Intelligence Platform

### Abstract

This research presents the development and implementation of Auto Intel, a comprehensive automotive data intelligence platform that integrates web scraping, artificial intelligence analysis, and interactive visualization to provide real-time market intelligence. The project addresses the critical need for automated, data-driven insights in the automotive industry by implementing a novel end-to-end pipeline from data collection to actionable intelligence presentation.

The research successfully addresses five primary objectives: (1) designing a database architecture for heterogeneous automotive data sources, (2) implementing AI approaches for optimal insights presentation, (3) developing an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, (4) creating a RESTful API for programmatic data access, and (5) establishing comprehensive logging and monitoring systems. The platform processes automotive news articles and car reviews from multiple sources, achieving 97.8% data completeness and 96.2% validation success rate.

The technical implementation leverages modern technologies including Scrapy for web scraping, PostgreSQL for data storage, FastAPI for API development, and Streamlit for interactive visualization. The AI analysis pipeline incorporates natural language processing techniques such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis using VADER, and correlation analysis, processing over 15,000 text entries and extracting 500+ named entities including car brands, models, and locations.

Performance metrics demonstrate the system's production readiness with 234ms average API response time, 127 requests/second throughput, and 99.87% system uptime. The platform successfully identifies market trends, consumer behavior patterns, and competitive intelligence through statistical analysis, revealing moderate positive correlation (r = 0.42) between price and rating, and strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between sentiment and rating.

The research contributes to the field of automotive data intelligence by establishing best practices for end-to-end data intelligence platforms, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating multiple data sources with AI-powered analysis, and providing a scalable framework applicable to other industry domains. The project's comprehensive approach, from data collection through interactive visualization, represents a significant advancement in automotive market intelligence capabilities.
